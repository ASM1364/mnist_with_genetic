# mnist_with_genetic: In this study, we are using the MNIST dataset and proposing a new approach for hyperparameter learning using genetic algorithm. The genes in our chromosome include: number of layers, activation function, learning rate, dense layer, dropout, and batch size. By utilizing genetic algorithm, we aim to efficiently optimize these hyperparameters to enhance the performance of our model in image classification tasks.
